# README

This codebase hosts a Nodejs sample application that acts as a middleware between Salesforce (payers) and EHR (provider systems). The application aims to facilitate self-service for providers to interact with the payer's Salesforce org hosting CRD, DTR, and PAS APIs. If built well, this could be leveraged as a SMART on FHIR App for UM use cases.

## Usage

It's required that all files must be placed at the top level of your repository.

> **NOTE** Your README should contain detailed, useful information about the project!
